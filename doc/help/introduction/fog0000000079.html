And hey, if you really need to execute a shell command, NAnt has an <EXEC>task that allows different commands to be executed based on the OS it is executing on.</P>        <P>For more information on why Ant and NAnt were developed read the <A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual/">Ant Introduction</A>. </P>    </body></html>
